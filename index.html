          <p class="description">Many students in high school have a strong interest in gaming, and they also wonder 
            how to take part in the game. I was one of them. I developed an bot script Ranked 
            Matchmaking AI for dota2, which is my favorite game, in high school and to be honest, 
            this experience helps me a lot on my future CS courses.<a href="https://medium.com/@spuchuan19/develop-a-gaming-ai-

            Pet can really help you when you are upset. Adopting also means you help a small animal have a family.
            I adopted this cat in the first year of covid. I was really sad when I can't go home when the winter break came. 
              She was found skinny around 4 months old and pregnented. I keep her name, Stevie, that given by the adoption center stuff.
